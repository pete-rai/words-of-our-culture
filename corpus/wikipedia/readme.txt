 I actually got the bubbles working for a major subset of Wikipedia (over four
 million topics). Surprisingly, it all still fitted neatly into a mysql and no
 big data tech was required. It did however, require to many subtle tweaks in the
 schema. Also, I couldn't find a cheap mysql host to put it on as the storage and
 processing is high.

 Anyway, if you want to know more about doing the bubbles thing over wikipedia
 data, then contact me on pete(at)rai.org.uk
