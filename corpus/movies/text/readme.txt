The corpus for this project is all the things uttered in all the greatest movies
in the English language. So it's quite a resource!

Building the corpus was a big job! Using the scripts in the gather folder was the
start, but there was also lots of hand-rolling after that too. I would really
LOVE TO share the outputs of this with you, however I must respect the concerns
of the copyright holders. To put the raw text into GitHub would certain infringe
on their rights. So I can only share with you the method to get the corpus and
also the derived works from it.

If you want to get hold of the raw corpus, then email me at pete(at)rai.org.uk
